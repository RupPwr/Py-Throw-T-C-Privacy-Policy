    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <h2>Py Throw</h2>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 26 December 2025</p>
    <p><strong>Developed by:</strong> Rup's Laboratory</p>

    <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
    <p>Welcome to Py Throw, an offline Python interpreter application developed by Rup's Laboratory. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle, collect, and protect your information when you use our application. Py Throw is a specially designed educational application created exclusively for students to write, execute, and learn Python programming directly on their Android devices without requiring an internet connection.</p>

    <h3>2. Data Collection and Use</h3>
    <p>Py Throw is designed with minimal data collection in mind. The application only collects data that you explicitly provide:<br><br>
    - User-Created Python Files: Code files and scripts that you create and save<br>
    - User-Generated Content: Any text, code, or files that you upload or create<br><br>
    Your data is used solely to enable you to write, edit, execute Python code, store your files, and provide educational functionality. All data access occurs only after explicit user action. Py Throw does not access any files or data without user knowledge or consent.</p>

    <h3>3. File Storage and Access</h3>
    <p><strong>Local Storage Only:</strong><br>
    All Python (.py) files created or imported using Py Throw are stored locally on the user's device.<br><br>
    <strong>User-Selected Storage Location:</strong><br>
    Py Throw allows users to select a preferred folder using Android's system file picker during the first file save. Storage access is granted only after explicit user action and consent through the system interface.<br><br>
    Once a folder is selected, that location is saved in the application and can be changed by the user through the app interface. The application automatically saves all files to the chosen location. Py Throw does not access any files or folders that are not explicitly selected by the user.<br><br>
    <strong>No Data Transmission:</strong><br>
    Py Throw operates completely offline and does not transmit, upload, or share any user data.</p>

    <h3>4. Permissions</h3>
    <p><strong>No Internet Permission:</strong><br>
    Py Throw does NOT request internet permission and cannot access the internet in any form.<br><br>
    <strong>Storage Access:</strong><br>
    Py Throw uses Android's system file picker to allow users to select folders for storing Python files. Storage access is granted only after user approval through the system interface during the first file save.<br><br>
    The application does not request broad storage permissions and does not scan or access unrelated files or personal media.</p>

    <h3>5. Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p><strong>No Third-Party Data Sharing:</strong> We do not share your data with any third-party services, advertisers, or analytics platforms.<br><br>
    <strong>Open-Source Libraries:</strong><br>
    - Python - Python Software Foundation<br>
    - Chaquopy - Python interpreter for Android<br>
    - Kotlin Coroutines - Background operations<br>
    - JUnit - Testing<br><br>
    No tracking, crash reporting, or analytics integrated.</p>

    <h3>6. Advertisements</h3>
    <p>Py Throw is an ad-free application. We do not display any advertisements, sponsored content, or promotional materials. You can use the application without interruptions or commercial distractions.</p>

The application does not perform automatic data transmission or any background file access.</p>

    <h3>9. Security</h3>
    <p><strong>Data Protection:</strong> All user data, including Python scripts and files, is stored locally on the user's device.<br><br>
    <strong>Code Execution Disclaimer:</strong> Py Throw allows users to write and execute Python code locally for educational and learning purposes only.
