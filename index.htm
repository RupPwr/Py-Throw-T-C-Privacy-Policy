            <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
            <p>Welcome to Py Throw, an offline Python interpreter application developed by Rup's Laboratory. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle, collect, and protect your information when you use our application.

Py Throw is a specially designed educational application created exclusively for students to write, execute, and learn Python programming directly on their Android devices without requiring an internet connection.</p>

            <h3>2. Data Collection and Use</h3>
            <p>Py Throw is designed with minimal data collection in mind. The application only collects data that you explicitly provide:

• User-Created Python Files: Code files and scripts that you create and save
• User-Generated Content: Any text, code, or files that you upload or create

Your data is used solely to enable you to write, edit, execute Python code, store your files, and provide educational functionality.</p>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>3. Data Storage and Security</h3>
            <p>Local Storage Only: All data collected by Py Throw is stored exclusively on your device's internal storage. We do not transmit, upload, or store your data on any remote servers or cloud services.

No Data Transmission: Py Throw operates completely offline and does not have internet connectivity permissions. Your privacy stays with your device.

Data Deletion: You have full control over your files and can delete them at any time directly through the application.</p>
